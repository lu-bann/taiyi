# Deregistration

## Command Structure

```bash
taiyi-cli deregister [OPTIONS]
```

## Global Options

| Option | Description | Environment Variable | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| `--execution-rpc-url` | Ethereum RPC endpoint URL | `EXECUTION_RPC_URL` | - |
| `--private-key` | Operator's private key in hex format | `PRIVATE_KEY` | - |
| `--taiyi-eigenlayer-middleware-address` | Taiyi EigenLayer Middleware contract address | `TAIYI_EIGENLAYER_MIDDLEWARE_ADDRESS` | - |

## Deregistration Example

```bash
taiyi-cli deregister \
  --execution-rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com \
  --private-key 0x123... \
  --taiyi-eigenlayer-middleware-address 0x456...
```

## Contract Addresses

For Holesky testnet:
- Taiyi EigenLayer Middleware: `<TAIYI_EIGENLAYER_MIDDLEWARE_ADDRESS>`

## Deregistration Process

1. **Transaction Submission**:
   - Submits deregistration transaction to the Taiyi EigenLayer Middleware contract
   - Transaction is signed with operator's private key

2. **Confirmation**:
   - Waits for transaction confirmation
   - Verifies transaction inclusion in a block

## Important Notes

1. **Before Deregistering**:
   - Ensure all active duties are completed
   - Withdraw any pending rewards
   - Complete any ongoing validations

2. **Effects of Deregistration**:
   - Removes operator from active validator set
   - Stops receiving new validation duties
   - May affect staking rewards

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Only the registered operator can deregister
   - Cannot be undone without re-registration
   - Verify you're using the correct network

## Cooldown Period

After deregistration:
- May have a cooldown period before funds can be withdrawn
- Check contract specifications for exact timing
- Monitor transaction status for completion

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Transaction Failures**:
   - Verify operator is currently registered
   - Ensure sufficient ETH for gas
   - Check contract permissions

2. **Authorization Issues**:
   - Confirm private key matches registered operator
   - Verify contract address is correct
   - Check network connection

3. **RPC Connection**:
   - Verify RPC endpoint is accessible
   - Try alternative RPC providers
   - Check network status

4. **Post-Deregistration**:
   - Confirm deregistration status
   - Verify all duties are completed
   - Check withdrawal availability
