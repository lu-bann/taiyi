## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

* Completed the [system requirements](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/system_requirements)

* An Ethereum validator node on the Holesky testnet

## Dependencies

First, install Rust using rustup

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

> **Tips**- During installation, when prompted, enter `1` for the default installation.
>
> - After Rust installation completes, try running `cargo version` . If it cannot
>   be found, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`. After that, running `cargo version` should return the version, for example `cargo 1.68.2`.
>
> - It's generally advisable to append `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to `~/.bashrc`.

With Rust installed, follow the instructions below to install dependencies relevant to your
operating system:

* **Ubuntu**: `apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config build-essential`

* **macOS**: `brew install llvm pkg-config`

* **Windows**: `choco install llvm` or `winget install LLVM.LLVM`

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is 1.82.0. If you already have a version of Rust installed,
you can check your version by running `rustc --version`. To update your version of Rust, run `rustup update`.
## 1. Build Core Components

### Build commit-boost

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client.git
cd commit-boost-client
git checkout v0.6.0
cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/commit-boost-signer
```

### Build taiyi-boost

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/taiyi-boost
```

### Configure commit-boost

Create `cb-config.toml`, you can see a full example in the [Commit-Boost Client](https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/blob/main/config.example.toml): 

```toml
chain = "Holesky"

# Configuration for the PBS module
[pbs]
docker_image = "ghcr.io/commit-boost/pbs:latest"
with_signer = true
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 18550
relay_check = true
wait_all_registrations = true
timeout_get_header_ms = 950
timeout_get_payload_ms = 4000
timeout_register_validator_ms = 3000
skip_sigverify = false
min_bid_eth = 0.0
relay_monitors = []
late_in_slot_time_ms = 2000
extra_validation_enabled = false
rpc_url = "https://rpc.holesky.luban.wtf"

# The PBS module needs one or more [[relays]] as defined below.
[[relays]]
# Relay ID to use in telemetry
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: URL hostname
id = "taiyi-relay"
# Relay URL in the format scheme://pubkey@host
url = "http://0xadc0fe12e62c14a505ea1e655dbe4d36fa505ed57b634ba37912153d29edd45c5bc5a77764e68b98c53e3f6f8ce9fa3b@relay.holesky.luban.wtf"
# Headers to send with each request for this relay
# OPTIONAL
# headers = { X-MyCustomHeader = "MyCustomValue" }
# Whether to enable timing games, as tuned by `target_first_request_ms` and `frequency_get_header_ms`.
# These values should be carefully chosen for each relay, as each relay has different latency and timing games setups.
# They should only be used by advanced users, and if mis-configured can result in unforeseen effects, e.g. fetching a lower header value,
# or getting a temporary IP ban.
#
# EXAMPLES
# Assuming: timeout_get_header_ms = 950, frequency_get_header_ms = 300, target_first_request_ms = 200, late_in_slot_time_ms = 2000
#
# 1) CL request comes at 100ms in the slot (max timeout 1050ms in the slot), then:
#   - sleep for 100ms
#   - send request at 200ms with 850ms timeout
#   - send request at 500ms with 550ms timeout
#   - send request at 800ms with 250ms timeout
# 2) CL request comes at 1500ms in the slot (max timeout 2000ms in the slot), then:
#   - send request at 1500ms with 500ms timeout
#   - send request at 1800ms with 200ms timeout
# 3) CL request comes 2500ms in the slot then:
#   - return 204 and force local build
#
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: false
enable_timing_games = false
# Target time in slot when to send the first header request
# OPTIONAL
target_first_request_ms = 200
# Frequency in ms to send get_header requests
# OPTIONAL
frequency_get_header_ms = 300
# Maximum number of validators to register in a single request.
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: "" (unlimited)
validator_registration_batch_size = ""

# Configuration for the Signer Module, only required if any `commit` module is present, or if `pbs.with_signer = true`
# Currently two types of Signer modules are supported (only one can be used at a time):
#   - Remote: a remote Web3Signer instance
#   - Local: a local Signer module
# More details on the docs (https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/configuration/#local-signer)

docker_image = "ghcr.io/commit-boost/signer:latest"
# Configuration for how the Signer module should load validator keys. Currently two types of loaders are supported:
#   - File: load keys from a plain text file (unsafe, use only for testing purposes)
#   - ValidatorsDir: load keys from a `keys` and `secrets` file/folder (ERC-2335 style keystores). More details can be found in the docs (https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/configuration/)

```

### Start commit-boost-signer Services

Before start commit-boost-signer, you need to set the environment variables.

#### Set Environment Variables

```bash
export CB_CONFIG=config.toml
export CB_JWTS=taiyi=xxxxx
export CB_SIGNER_PORT=20000
```

<Note>
  Please generate your own jwt token for `CB_JWTS`. You could use command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a random token.
  Make sure the `CB_JWTS` is the same as `CB_SIGNER_JWT` in the taiyi-boost env config.
  You don't need to use engine_jwt here.
</Note>

#### Start commit-boost-signer

```bash
<path-to>/commit-boost-signer
```

You can probably see logs like below

```
2025-02-14T03:44:48.450459Z  INFO Starting signing service version="0.6.0" commit="adf548b6296fdb4ce38903260ac24be5c4e022bb" modules=["taiyi"] port=20000 loaded_consensus=64 loaded_proxies=0
2025-02-14T03:44:48.453441Z  INFO Starting metrics server on port 10000
```

Now the signer module is up in port 20000


### Start taiyi-boost Services

#### Set Environment Variables

```bash
export CB_CONFIG=config.toml
export CB_SIGNER_JWT=taiyi=xx
export CB_SIGNER_URL=http://localhost:20000
```
<Note>
  Please generate your own jwt token for `CB_SIGNER_JWT`. You could use command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a random token.
  Make sure the `CB_SIGNER_JWT` is the same as `CB_JWTS` in the commit-boost-signer env config.
  You don't need to use engine_jwt here.
</Note>

#### Start taiyi-boost

```bash
<path-to>/taiyi-boost
```
You can probably see logs like below

```
2025-02-14T03:46:05.353940Z  INFO starting PBS service version="0.6.0" commit="adf548b6296fdb4ce38903260ac24be5c4e022bb" addr=127.0.0.1:18550 events_subs=0 chain=Holesky

```

Now the taiyi-boost is up on port 18550

## 2. Configure Your Validator or your commit boost pbs

### Update Relay Configuration in your beacon node

For example, with Lighthouse beacon node:

```bash
lighthouse beacon \
    --builder=http://127.0.0.1:18550 \
    ...# your other config
```

### Update Relay Configuration in your commit boost pbs

Put the taiyi-boost as your relays or mux relays in `config.toml`.

```toml
[[relays]]
id = "taiyi-relay"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18550"
```

or 

```toml
[[mux_relays]]
id = "taiyi-relay"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18550"
```

<Note>
  For a complete list of relay and gateway endpoints, see the [Supported Endpoints](/network_info/supported_endpoints) page.
</Note>

## 3. Tool Installation 

### Install Taiyi CLI

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
cargo build --release --bin taiyi-cli
```
 
<Note>
  For detailed information about other commands, see the [Taiyi-CLI](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/taiyi_cli).
</Note>

## Next Steps

With your node components installed and configured, you're ready to proceed to the [Protocol Opt-in](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/protocol_opt_in) process where you'll:

1. Deposit stake into EigenLayer's strategy contract

2. Register as a Taiyi operator

3. Delegate your validator keys to the Gateway

4. Verify your registration and stake
