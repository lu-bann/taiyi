### Taiyi-boost with commit-boost-pbs

The commit-boost-pbs module is more for advanced node operators who want to interact with multiple different protocol with different sidecars.
The docs is not going to demonstrate how to set up commit-boost-pbs. You need to see the details in [commit-boost](https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/).

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

* Completed the [system requirements](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/system_requirements)

* An Ethereum validator node on the Holesky testnet

## Dependencies

First, install Rust using rustup

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

> **Tips**- During installation, when prompted, enter `1` for the default installation.
>
> - After Rust installation completes, try running `cargo version` . If it cannot
>   be found, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`. After that, running `cargo version` should return the version, for example `cargo 1.68.2`.
>
> - It's generally advisable to append `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to `~/.bashrc`.

With Rust installed, follow the instructions below to install dependencies relevant to your
operating system:

* **Ubuntu**: `apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config build-essential`

* **macOS**: `brew install llvm pkg-config`

* **Windows**: `choco install llvm` or `winget install LLVM.LLVM`

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is 1.82.0. If you already have a version of Rust installed,
you can check your version by running `rustc --version`. To update your version of Rust, run `rustup update`.
## 1. Build Core Components

### Build commit-boost

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client.git
cd commit-boost-client
git checkout v0.6.0
cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/commit-boost-signer
```

### Build taiyi-boost

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/taiyi-boost
```

### Configure commit-boost signer

Create `signer-config.toml`, you can see a full example in the [Commit-Boost Client](https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/blob/main/config.example.toml): 

```toml
chain = "Holesky"

# the pbs config below are not usefule for commit boost signer, but it is required to make sure config is parsed correctly
[pbs]
port = 18550

# the relays config below are not usefule for commit boost signer, but it is required to make sure config is parsed correctly
[[relays]]
id = "mev_relay_0"
url = "http://b2796db1455143b39c4b6104dddbaf3fdca059009b9df3f61c729bac81cadd355fcc3fc61f5185a4748eb3bf298c0ad0@localhost:18550"


# The signer config below are the essential config for commit boost signer
# If you want to see other options for config please see the [Commit-Boost Client](https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/configuration/)
[signer.local.loader]
# File: path to the keys file
# key_path = "./tests/data/keys.example.json"
# ValidatorsDir: format of the keystore (lighthouse, prysm, teku or lodestar)
format = "lighthouse"
# ValidatorsDir: full path to the keys directory
# For lighthouse, it's de path to the directory where the `<pubkey>/voting-keystore.json` directories are located.
# For prysm, it's the path to the `all-accounts.keystore.json` file.
# For teku, it's the path to the directory where all `<pubkey>.json` files are located.
# For lodestar, it's the path to the directory where all `<pubkey>.json` files are located.
keys_path = "/root/1-lighthouse-reth-0-63-0/keys"
# ValidatorsDir: full path to the secrets file/directory
# For lighthouse, it's de path to the directory where the `<pubkey>.json` files are located.
# For prysm, it's the path to the file containing the wallet decryption password.
# For teku, it's the path to the directory where all `<pubkey>.txt` files are located.
# For lodestar, it's the path to the file containing the decryption password.
secrets_path = "/root/1-lighthouse-reth-0-63-0/secrets"
# Configuration for how the Signer module should store proxy delegations. Supported types of store are:
#   - File: store keys and delegations from a plain text file (unsafe, use only for testing purposes)
#   - ERC2335: store keys and delegations safely using ERC-2335 style keystores. More details can be found in the docs (https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/configuration#proxy-keys-store)
# OPTIONAL, if missing proxies are lost on restart
# [signer.local.store]
# File: path to the keys file
# proxy_dir = "./proxies"
# ERC2335: path to the keys directory
# keys_path = "./tests/data/proxy/keys"
# ERC2335: path to the secrets directory
# secrets_path = "./tests/data/proxy/secrets"

```

### Start commit-boost-signer Services

Before start commit-boost-signer, you need to set the environment variables.

#### Set Environment Variables

```bash
export CB_CONFIG=config.toml
export CB_JWTS=taiyi=xxxxx
export CB_SIGNER_PORT=20000
```

<Note>
  Please generate your own jwt token for `CB_JWTS`. You could use command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a random token.
  Make sure the `CB_JWTS` is the same as `CB_SIGNER_JWT` in the taiyi-boost env config.
  You don't need to use engine_jwt here.
</Note>

#### Start commit-boost-signer

```bash
<path-to>/commit-boost-signer
```

You can probably see logs like below

```
2025-02-14T03:44:48.450459Z  INFO Starting signing service version="0.6.0" commit="adf548b6296fdb4ce38903260ac24be5c4e022bb" modules=["taiyi"] port=20000 loaded_consensus=64 loaded_proxies=0
2025-02-14T03:44:48.453441Z  INFO Starting metrics server on port 10000
```

Now the signer module is up in port 20000


### Start taiyi-boost Services

Create `taiyi-boost-config.toml`, the example is as follows:

```toml
# Configuration for the PBS module
[pbs]
docker_image = "ghcr.io/commit-boost/pbs:latest"
with_signer = true
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 18550
relay_check = true
wait_all_registrations = true
timeout_get_header_ms = 950
timeout_get_payload_ms = 4000
timeout_register_validator_ms = 3000
skip_sigverify = false
min_bid_eth = 0.0
relay_monitors = []
late_in_slot_time_ms = 2000
extra_validation_enabled = false
rpc_url = "https://rpc.holesky.luban.wtf" # better to use your own rpc url

# below are config for taiyi-boost specifically
engine_api="https://rpc-execution.holesky.luban.wtf" # better to use your own engine api
execution_api="https://rpc.holesky.luban.wtf" # better to use your own execution api

builder_private_key="5168bdd781a2793f24f53f605f60e79a8bfa9a5737126a205b98db253ed339c2"  # you should use your own builder_private_key
engine_jwt="03d15cbd2b802dfe3449eaa2d2690a90191daa39f38e30282a255fcacfde8faf"  # you should use your own engine_jwt
network="holesky"

# The PBS module needs one or more [[relays]] as defined below.
[[relays]]
# Relay ID to use in telemetry
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: URL hostname
id = "taiyi-relay"
# Relay URL in the format scheme://pubkey@host
# please do not change this !!!
# It is connecting our builder to build a preconf block
url = "https://b2796db1455143b39c4b6104dddbaf3fdca059009b9df3f61c729bac81cadd355fcc3fc61f5185a4748eb3bf298c0ad9@relay.holesky.luban.wtf" 
# Headers to send with each request for this relay
# OPTIONAL
# headers = { X-MyCustomHeader = "MyCustomValue" }
# Whether to enable timing games, as tuned by `target_first_request_ms` and `frequency_get_header_ms`.
# These values should be carefully chosen for each relay, as each relay has different latency and timing games setups.
# They should only be used by advanced users, and if mis-configured can result in unforeseen effects, e.g. fetching a lower header value,
# or getting a temporary IP ban.
#
# EXAMPLES
# Assuming: timeout_get_header_ms = 950, frequency_get_header_ms = 300, target_first_request_ms = 200, late_in_slot_time_ms = 2000
#
# 1) CL request comes at 100ms in the slot (max timeout 1050ms in the slot), then:
#   - sleep for 100ms
#   - send request at 200ms with 850ms timeout
#   - send request at 500ms with 550ms timeout
#   - send request at 800ms with 250ms timeout
# 2) CL request comes at 1500ms in the slot (max timeout 2000ms in the slot), then:
#   - send request at 1500ms with 500ms timeout
#   - send request at 1800ms with 200ms timeout
# 3) CL request comes 2500ms in the slot then:
#   - return 204 and force local build
#
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: false
enable_timing_games = false
# Target time in slot when to send the first header request
# OPTIONAL
target_first_request_ms = 200
# Frequency in ms to send get_header requests
# OPTIONAL
frequency_get_header_ms = 300
# Maximum number of validators to register in a single request.
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: "" (unlimited)
validator_registration_batch_size = ""
```

#### Set Environment Variables

```bash
export CB_CONFIG=taiyi-boost-config.toml
export CB_SIGNER_JWT=taiyi=xx
export CB_SIGNER_URL=http://localhost:20000
```
<Note>
  Please generate your own jwt token for `CB_SIGNER_JWT`. You could use command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a random token.
  Make sure the `CB_SIGNER_JWT` is the same as `CB_JWTS` in the commit-boost-signer env config.
  You don't need to use engine_jwt here.
</Note>

#### Start taiyi-boost

```bash
<path-to>/taiyi-boost
```
You can probably see logs like below

```
2025-02-14T03:46:05.353940Z  INFO starting PBS service version="0.6.0" commit="adf548b6296fdb4ce38903260ac24be5c4e022bb" addr=127.0.0.1:18550 events_subs=0 chain=Holesky

```

Now the taiyi-boost is up on port 18550

## 2. Configure Your Validator or your commit boost pbs

### Update Relay Configuration in your beacon node

For example, with Lighthouse beacon node:

```bash
lighthouse beacon \
    --builder=http://127.0.0.1:18550 \
    ...# your other config
```

### Update Relay Configuration in your commit boost pbs

Put the taiyi-boost as your relays or mux relays in `config.toml`.

```toml
[[relays]]
id = "taiyi-relay"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18550" # your taiyi-boost service
```

or 

```toml
[[mux_relays]]
id = "taiyi-relay"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18550" # your taiyi-boost service
```

<Note>
  For a complete list of relay and gateway endpoints, see the [Supported Endpoints](/network_info/supported_endpoints) page.
</Note>

## 3. Tool Installation 

### Install Taiyi CLI

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
cargo build --release --bin taiyi-cli
```
 
<Note>
  For detailed information about other commands, see the [Taiyi-CLI](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/taiyi_cli).
</Note>

## Next Steps

With your node components installed and configured, you're ready to proceed to the [Protocol Opt-in](/node_operator_setup_guide/holesky/protocol_opt_in) process where you'll:

1. Deposit stake into EigenLayer's strategy contract

2. Register as a Taiyi operator

3. Delegate your validator keys to the Gateway

4. Verify your registration and stake
