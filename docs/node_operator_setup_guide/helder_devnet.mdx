# Deploy commit-boost-signer and taiyi-boost

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying `commit-boost-signer` and `taiyi-boost` on the Helder Devnet.

## Prerequisites

- A Helder validator (reth + lighthouse bn + lighthouse vc) deployed on the same server

## Build Binaries

### commit-boost-signer

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client.git
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/commit-boost-signer
   ```

   The target binary will be located at `./target/release/commit-boost-signer`.

### taiyi-boost

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lu-bann/taiyi.git
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/taiyi-boost
   ```

   The target binary will be located at `./target/release/taiyi-boost`.

## Configuration

Create a configuration file that will be shared by both `cb-signer` and `taiyi-boost`. Save this as `cb-config.toml`:
<Accordion title="sample cb-config.toml">
```bash

# How late in milliseconds in the slot is "late". This impacts the `get_header` requests, by shortening timeouts for `get_header` calls to

# to force local building and miniminzing the risk of missed slots. See also the timing games section below

# Headers to send with each request for this relay
# OPTIONAL
# headers = { X-MyCustomHeader = "MyCustomValue" }
# Whether to enable timing games, as tuned by `target_first_request_ms` and `frequency_get_header_ms`.
# These values should be carefully chosen for each relay, as each relay has different latency and timing games setups.
# They should only be used by advanced users, and if mis-configured can result in unforeseen effects, e.g. fetching a lower header value, 
# or getting a temporary IP ban.
# 
# EXAMPLES
# Assuming: timeout_get_header_ms = 950, frequency_get_header_ms = 300, target_first_request_ms = 200, late_in_slot_time_ms = 2000
# 
# 1) CL request comes at 100ms in the slot (max timeout 1050ms in the slot), then:
#   - sleep for 100ms
#   - send request at 200ms with 850ms timeout
#   - send request at 500ms with 550ms timeout
#   - send request at 800ms with 250ms timeout
# 2) CL request comes at 1500ms in the slot (max timeout 2000ms in the slot), then:
#   - send request at 1500ms with 500ms timeout
#   - send request at 1800ms with 200ms timeout
# 3) CL request comes 2500ms in the slot then:
#   - return 204 and force local build
#
# OPTIONAL, DEFAULT: false
enable_timing_games = false
# Target time in slot when to send the first header request
# OPTIONAL
target_first_request_ms = 200
