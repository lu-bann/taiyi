## Architecture Overview

### Taiyi-boost without commit-boost-pbs

The following diagram illustrates how the different components interact in the Taiyi ecosystem:

/>

### Taiyi-boost with commit-boost-pbs

The commit-boost-pbs module is more for advanced node operators who want to interact with multiple different protocol with different sidecars.
The docs is not going to demonstrate how to set up commit-boost-pbs. You need to see the details in [commit-boost](https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/).

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

* Completed the [system requirements](/node_operator_setup_guide/system_requirements)

* An Ethereum validator node on the testnet

## Dependencies

First, install Rust using rustup

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

> **Tips**- The `-y` flag accepts default installation options for non-interactive installation.
>
> - After Rust installation completes, try running `cargo version` . If it cannot
>   be found, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`. After that, running `cargo version` should return the version, for example `cargo 1.68.2`.
>
> - It's generally advisable to append `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to `~/.bashrc`.

With Rust installed, follow the instructions below to install dependencies relevant to your
operating system:

* **Ubuntu**: `apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config build-essential libssl-dev protobuf-compiler`

* **macOS**: `brew install llvm pkg-config openssl protobuf`

* **Windows**: `choco install llvm openssl protobuf` or `winget install LLVM.LLVM`

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is 1.82.0. If you already have a version of Rust installed,
you can check your version by running `rustc --version`. To update your version of Rust, run `rustup update`.
## 1. Build Core Components

### Build commit-boost

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client.git
cd commit-boost-client
git checkout v0.6.0
cargo build --release # target binary: ./target/release/commit-boost-signer
```

### Build taiyi-boost

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
git checkout releases/v0.1.9
cargo build --release --bin taiyi-boost # target binary: ./target/release/taiyi-boost
```

### Configure commit-boost signer

Create `signer-config.toml`, you can see a full example in the [Commit-Boost Client](https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/blob/main/config.example.toml): 

<CodeGroup>
```toml holesky
chain = "Holesky"

# the pbs config below are not usefule for commit boost signer, but it is required to make sure config is parsed correctly
[pbs]
port = 18550

# the relays config below are not usefule for commit boost signer, but it is required to make sure config is parsed correctly
[[relays]]
id = "mev_relay_0"
url = "http://b2796db1455143b39c4b6104dddbaf3fdca059009b9df3f61c729bac81cadd355fcc3fc61f5185a4748eb3bf298c0ad0@localhost:18550"


# The signer config below are the essential config for commit boost signer
# If you want to see other options for config please see the [Commit-Boost Client](https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/configuration/)
[signer.local.loader]
# File: path to the keys file

# ValidatorsDir: format of the keystore (lighthouse, prysm, teku or lodestar)
format = "lighthouse"
# ValidatorsDir: full path to the keys directory
# For lighthouse, it's de path to the directory where the `<pubkey>/voting-keystore.json` directories are located.
# For prysm, it's the path to the `all-accounts.keystore.json` file.

# For lodestar, it's the path to the file containing the decryption password.
secrets_path = "/root/1-lighthouse-reth-0-63-0/secrets"
# Configuration for how the Signer module should store proxy delegations. Supported types of store are:
#   - File: store keys and delegations from a plain text file (unsafe, use only for testing purposes)
#   - ERC2335: store keys and delegations safely using ERC-2335 style keystores. More details can be found in the docs (https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/get_started/configuration#proxy-keys-store)
# OPTIONAL, if missing proxies are lost on restart
# [signer.local.store]
# File: path to the keys file

# ERC2335: path to the keys directory
# keys_path = "./tests/data/proxy/keys"

# secrets_path = "./tests/data/proxy/secrets"

```

```
</CodeGroup>

### Start commit-boost-signer Services

Before start commit-boost-signer, you need to set the environment variables.

#### Set Environment Variables

```bash
export CB_CONFIG=config.toml
export CB_JWTS=taiyi=xxxxx
export CB_SIGNER_PORT=20000
```

<Note>
  Please generate your own jwt token for `CB_JWTS`. You could use command `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a random token.
  Make sure the `CB_JWTS` is the same as `CB_SIGNER_JWT` in the taiyi-boost env config.
  You don't need to use engine_jwt here.
</Note>

#### Start commit-boost-signer

```bash
<path-to>/commit-boost-signer
```

You can probably see logs like below

```
2025-02-14T03:44:48.450459Z  INFO Starting signing service version="0.6.0" commit="adf548b6296fdb4ce38903260ac24be5c4e022bb" modules=["taiyi"] port=20000 loaded_consensus=64 loaded_proxies=0
2025-02-14T03:44:48.453441Z  INFO Starting metrics server on port 10000
```

Now the signer module is up in port 20000

```

Now the taiyi-boost is up on port 18550

## 2. Configure Your Validator or your commit boost pbs

### Update Relay Configuration in your beacon node

For example, with Lighthouse beacon node:

```bash
lighthouse beacon \
    --builder=http://127.0.0.1:18550 \
    ...# your other config
```

### Update Relay Configuration in your commit boost pbs

Put the taiyi-boost as your relays or mux relays in `config.toml`.

```toml
[[relays]]
id = "taiyi-relay"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18550" # your taiyi-boost service
```

or 

```toml
[[mux_relays]]
id = "taiyi-relay"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18550" # your taiyi-boost service
```

<Note>
  For a complete list of relay and gateway endpoints, see the [Supported Endpoints](/network_info/supported_endpoints) page.
</Note>

## 3. Tool Installation 

### Install Taiyi CLI

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lu-bann/taiyi.git
cd taiyi
git checkout dev
cargo build --release --bin taiyi-cli
```
 
<Note>
  For detailed information about other commands, see the [Taiyi-CLI](/node_operator_setup_guide/taiyi_cli).
</Note>

## Next Steps

With your node components installed and configured, you're ready to proceed to the [Protocol Opt-in](/node_operator_setup_guide/protocol_opt_in) process where you'll:

1. Deposit stake into EigenLayer's strategy contract

2. Register as a Taiyi operator

3. Delegate your validator keys to the Gateway

4. Verify your registration and stake
