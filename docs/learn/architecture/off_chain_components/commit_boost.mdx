</Note>

Taiyi integrates Commit-Boost to enable Ethereum validators to delegate their preconfirmation rights to third-party entities known as preconfirmers within the Taiyi ecosystem. This delegation is facilitated through a custom module called `taiyi-boost`, which is seamlessly integrated into the Commit-Boost client.

By leveraging this module, Taiyi creates a secure and efficient mechanism for validators to participate in the preconfirmation process without directly handling the complexities involved. This approach not only enhances the flexibility of the Taiyi protocol but also allows for specialized entities to optimize the preconfirmation process, potentially leading to improved overall network performance.

Taiyi-Boost is a specialized Commit-Boost module designed for Ethereum block proposers who wish to delegate their preconfirmation rights to a preconfirmer within the Taiyi ecosystem. This module is essential for proposers participating in the Taiyi protocol, as it enables the delegation process. It's important to note that for each slot, a proposer can only delegate to a single preconfirmer, ensuring a streamlined and efficient preconfirmation process.
