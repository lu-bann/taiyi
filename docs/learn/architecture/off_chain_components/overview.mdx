## Preconfirmation Transaction Lifecycle

For details on how these components work together in a preconfirmation transaction, see our [Life Cycle of a Preconf Transaction](/learn/fundamentals/life_cycle_of_a_preconf_tx) page. 
</Note>

The Taiyi protocol relies on several key off-chain components to facilitate the preconfirmation process and ensure smooth interaction between users and the blockchain. These components work together to process preconfirmation requests, validate transactions, and integrate with the Ethereum consensus mechanism. The main off-chain components include:

1. **RPC Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for user interactions, receiving preconfirmation requests and transaction data.

2. **Preconfer**: Validates and processes preconfirmation requests, signing them before submission to the relay.

3. **Relay**: Coordinates between preconfers, proposers, and block builders, managing the flow of transaction constraints and block proposals.

4. **Block Builder**: Constructs blocks that satisfy the given constraints, participating in the competitive block production process.

5. **Proposer**: Elects preconfers through delegation and interacts with the relay to facilitate block production.

These components work in concert to ensure that preconfirmation requests are processed efficiently and securely, ultimately leading to their inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain.
