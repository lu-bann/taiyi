    class SymbioticNetworkMiddleware {
    }
    class TaiyiProposerRegistry {
    }
    class GatewaySubnetwork {
    }
    class ValidatorSubnetwork {

    SymbioticNetworkMiddleware --> GatewaySubnetwork : manages(reward + slashing)
```

## Subnetwork Comparison

| Feature | Validator Subnetwork | Gateway Subnetwork |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Duties | Basic block proposal | Preconfirmation tasks |
| Rewards | Shared with Gateway Subnetwork | Shared with Validator Subnetwork |
| Slashing Conditions | Accepting blocks from non-opt in relays | Reneging on preconfirmation commitments |

## Symbiotic Integration

The `SymbioticNetworkMiddleware` implements several key [Symbiotic Primitive](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/architecture/primitives) through [**Symbiotic Middleware SDK**](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/middleware-sdk/middleware-development):

1. **[`KeyManagerBLS`](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/category/key-managers)** - Manages storage and validation of operator keys using BLS signatures
2. **[`EpochCapture`](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/middleware-sdk/api-reference/extensions/timestamp-captures/EpochCapture)** - A middleware extension that captures timestamps based on epochs
3. **[`EqualStakePower`](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/middleware-sdk/api-reference/extensions/stake-powers/EqualStakePower)** - Implementation of a 1:1 stake to voting power conversion
4. **[`OzAccessManaged`](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/middleware-sdk/api-reference/extensions/access-managers/OzAccessManaged)** - A middleware extension that integrates OpenZeppelin's AccessManaged for access control
5. **[`BaseOperators`](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/middleware-sdk/api-reference/extensions/operators/)** - Base contract for managing operator registration, keys, and vault relationships
6. **[`Subnetworks`](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/middleware-sdk/api-reference/extensions/Subnetworks)** - Contract for managing subnetworks that can be registered and controlled

#### 1. Validator Subnetwork Registration

    actor Operator
    participant SN as Symbiotic Network
    participant SMW as SymbioticNetworkMiddleware
    participant TPR as TaiyiProposerRegistry
    Operator->>SN: 1. register operator + opt-in
    Note over SN: Symbiotic base registration
    Operator->>SMW: 2. joinSubnetwork(VALIDATOR_SUBNETWORK)
    Note over SMW: Validator Subnetwork-specific registration
    SMW->>TPR: 3. registerOperator()
    Note over TPR: BLS key + signature + subnetwork info + vault info
    Note over Operator: ✓ Can earn passive income from preconfirmations
```

#### 2. Gateway Subnetwork Registration

    uint96 subnetwork
) external
```

Unpauses the calling operator's operations.

### Vault Management Functions

#### `registerOperatorVault`
```solidity
function registerOperatorVault(address vault) external
```
Registers a vault for the calling operator.

Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `vault` | `address` | The address of the vault to register |

#### `unregisterOperatorVault`


```solidity
function unregisterOperatorVault(address vault) external
```

Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `vault` | `address` | The address of the vault to unregister |

#### `pauseOperatorVault`
```solidity

```
Pauses the operations of a vault for the calling operator.

Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description |

| `vault` | `address` | The address of the vault to pause |

#### `unpauseOperatorVault`
```solidity
function unpauseOperatorVault(address vault) external
```

Unpauses the operations of a vault for the calling operator.

Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `vault` | `address` | The address of the vault to unpause |

### Slashing Functions

#### `slash`
```solidity
function slash(SlashParams calldata params) external
```

```solidity
struct SlashParams {
        uint48 timestamp;
        bytes key;
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 subnetwork;
        bytes[] slashHints;
    }
```

Slashes an operator's stake across their active vaults. The slashing amount is distributed proportionally across the operator's vaults based on their relative stake amounts. The function:

1. Verifies the operator and their vaults are active at the given timestamp
2. Calculates proportional slash amounts for each vault based on the would-be slashed operator stake percentage
3. Executes slashing on each vault, with any dust amount from rounding going to the final vault

For example, if an operator has:
- Vault A with 1000 ETH staked (50%)
- Vault B with 800 ETH staked (40%)
- Vault C with 200 ETH staked (10%)

And a slash amount of 101 ETH is imposed:
- Vault A would be slashed 50.5 ETH (50% of 101)
- Vault B would be slashed 40.4 ETH (40% of 101)
- Vault C would be slashed 10.1 ETH (10% of 101)

Due to integer division and rounding, the actual amounts would be:
- Vault A: 50 ETH
- Vault B: 40 ETH  
- Vault C: 11 ETH (10 ETH + 1 ETH remaining from rounding)

If the slash amount was 51 ETH instead, the extra 1 ETH "dust" from rounding would go to the final vault (Vault C), making its slash 6 ETH.


Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `params` | `SlashParams` | The parameters for the slash operation including key, timestamp, subnetwork, amount and hints |
