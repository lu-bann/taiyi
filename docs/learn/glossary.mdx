#### Commit-Boost:
[Commit-Boost](https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client) is a proposer commitment side car that allows validators to make commitments to the block proposer.

#### Commitment Deadline:
This is a time limit set for accepting commitments to ensure they can be included and bordcasted to the block builders by the relay.

#### Epoch and Slot:
These are time-based concepts in Ethereum. An epoch is a fixed period consisting of multiple slots, and a slot is a unit of time during which a block can be proposed. Through the documentation, otherwise separately noted, epoch and slots are defined according to the [consensus client spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs). 

#### Gateway:
Unless otherwise specified, it refers to a preconfirmer. 

#### Opt-in Validator:
A validator that chooses to participate in the preconfirmation protocol, allowing their slots to be used for preconfirmation services.

#### Preconfirmation:
Preconfirmation is a mechanism that allows transactions to be confirmed before they are included in a block on Ethereum L1. This process aims to reduce latency and improve the user experience by providing faster transaction feedback.

#### Preconfirmer:
A preconfirmer is a specialized node in the Taiyi network responsible for processing and validating transactions before they are included in a block. Preconfirmers act as intermediaries between users and the blockchain, helping to expedite the transaction confirmation process. It is interchangeable with "based sequencer" and plays a key role in transaction processing and sequencing.

#### PreconfRequest:
A PreconfRequest combines a TipTx and a PreconfTx with associated signatures. It's the complete package of information needed for the preconfirmation process.

#### PreconfTx, aka Preconfirmation Transaction:
A PreconfTx represents the actual transaction that a user wants to execute with preconfirmation. It contains standard transaction details like sender, recipient, value, and additional preconfirmation-specific information.

#### Second-Price Auction:
An auction format where the highest bidder wins but pays the amount of the second-highest bid. It encourages truthful bidding by reducing incentives to overbid.

#### Sealed Bid Auction:
An auction where all bidders submit their bids without knowing the bids of other participants. In this context, it uses a commit-reveal scheme to ensure confidentiality during the commit phase.

#### Slashing Mechanisms:
Protocol rules that penalize participants (e.g., preconfirmers or validators) for misbehavior by confiscating a portion or all of their staked tokens.
